Automatically inserts a TokenTracker token into your posts and pages on publishing.

== Description ==

TokenTracker is a web service which issues electronic tokens - when you publish a post (or page) a token will get inserted into your post. 

TokenTracker will then track where your tokens get syndicated on the web and generate analytics about where, when, who and unique visitors to your tokens.

The plugin will also assign any of the posts tags with the token - you'll then be able to see what tags are most popular. 

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and unzip.
2. Upload the tokentracker directory to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for TokenTracker.
4. Go to the menu TokenTracker -> Settings, and enter your TokenTracker API key.
